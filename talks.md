### More Information

I'm a Data Scientist @HashResearch Labs. My journey till was pretty interesting and a bit long way. I started my careers building my first startup in the mechanical domain when I was my 10th Grade :). I never like to settle in a normal routine task because the innovator in me keep on pushing me to reach to a position what I am now.
