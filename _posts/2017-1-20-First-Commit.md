title: First Commit!
---

First, commit is my first post in my blog. I usually blog at Wordpress or Blogger. But now its time for something much simpler and stronger. So I decided to start writing some Markdown. I was initially focused on maintaining a well-designed blog which was any newbies first preference. Later I came to give more importance to the content than design aspects of my blog. So let me come to the point. I don't have any hidden agenda behind this blog. I will be writing some certain interesting engineering and data sciences challenges which we are actively facing and how we solved it using minimal approaches. We will be coming across Machine Learning, Data Science, Deep Learning and Neural networks in upcoming posts. My main aim is to give some clarity in these domains which any newbies consider a pain point. So lets get started.
